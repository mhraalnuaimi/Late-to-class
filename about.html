        <h2>About the 30 Minute Film Festival</h2>
        <p>
            The 30 Minute Film Festival is a challenge where people have to make a whole short film in just 30 minutes. You have to think fast, work with your team, and get creative. It’s exciting, sometimes stressful, but also really fun.
        </p>

            For this festival, three NYUAD freshmen, Mhara, Meera, and Mouza, made <strong>Late To Class</strong>. They only had half an hour, but they created a story that’s funny, a little mysterious, and really interesting. It shows how you can make something great even when time is limited.

            The festival is not just about making films. It’s about trying something new, working together, and enjoying the process. Every film is different because everyone has their own ideas, and the time limit makes it exciting to see what people come up with. It’s a great way to learn, be creative, and have fun all at the same time.
