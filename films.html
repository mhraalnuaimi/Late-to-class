        <p><strong>Film Title:</strong> Late To Class</p>
        <p><strong>Made by:</strong> Mhara, Meera, Mouza</p>

            The film is about three girls who are late to class. Two of them make it in on time, but the third one disappears. What happened? You’ll have to watch to find out. The story is funny, a little mysterious, and shows what can happen when you have to make decisions quickly.

            Making a film in just 30 minutes is not easy. The students had to come up with a story, act, film, and edit all in a short time. It shows how teamwork, creativity, and quick thinking can make something really cool. Watching this film is fun because you can see all the little details they added in such a short time.
