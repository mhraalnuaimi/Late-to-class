      <p>
        Welcome to the 30 Minute Film Festival. This is a fun project where people make short films in only 30 minutes from start to finish. That means you have to come up with a story, film it, and edit it super fast. It’s kind of crazy, but it makes everyone really creative and quick-thinking.

        Right now, we are showing <strong>Late To Class</strong>, made by MMM Production. Three students made this film in just half an hour. It’s funny, a little mysterious, and full of energy. Watching it is kind of like watching a story unfold really fast, and you can see all the cool ideas they came up with in a short time.
